### Installation (w/o GPU)

To install kubeflow, you need to have a running kubernetes cluster, either an existing running one or you can just create one.

In this tutorial, we create a kubernetes cluster on top of minikube, a single node version of kubernetes, and install kubeflow on top of it.


* [dockerd](install/dockerd.sh)
* [minikube](install/minikube.sh)
* [kubeflow-v1.2](install/kubeflow.v12.sh)
* [kubeflow-v1.3](install/kubeflow.v13.sh)
